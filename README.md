# Line change monitor dashboard

The goal of this project is to maintain a near real time dashboard that display basic statistics of vessel performance during line changes.

## Process tab
The dashboard admin have access right to this page where it is possible to add new data and extract data for the line change period.

## Summary tab
In the summary tab a table with statistics for each line change is produced as well as the average values by turn area. In that tab is also possible
to display line plots of the three main statistics being monitored.

`average speed`: the average vessel bottom speed during line change.</p>
`distance travelled`: the total distance travelled by the vessel during the line change, in km.</p>
`line change duration`: total time the vessel used to travel the turn</p>

## Plots tab
Here scatter plot of vessel easting and northing and histogram of speed distribution during line change.
